            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
            <p>
                In the Hawaiian language, kuleana can be defined as accepting responsibility with understanding and intent.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is our kuleana to serve our community to the best of our ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Maui Ku'ia Estate Chocolate, it is our privilege to support our local nonprofit community and implement pono practices into our business operations.
            </p>

                <h3>HOW WE GOT HERE</h3>

                                    In 2013, Dr. Gunars Valkirs, leased the farmland that would become the Maui Ku'ia Estate cacao farm.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He began work on a cacao farm operation with the first cacao plantings and blessings occurring on the
                                    2013 winter solstice.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The winter solstice marks the estate's oldest trees - special hybrids that were created by our VP of Farm &
                                    Factory Operations, Dan O’Doherty.
                                </p>

                                    By the time the first ten acres were planted in 2016, Gunars had to decide how to keep growing
                                    high-quality cacao while also maintaining an economically sustainable farm.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The only way to make the business viable was to make and sell chocolate, but Gunars had a bigger
                                    mission.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Though the farm may have started as a hobby for our CEO, the decision to start a chocolate company was
                                    born.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Through their family foundation, Makana Aloha Foundation, Gunars and his wife, JoRene, recognized that
                                    the needs in the non-profit community could not be met by current funding and wanted to do more.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They decided to invest in building a chocolate company where 100% of net-profits would be given back to
                                    the Maui community, their home.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The decision to create a mission-driven chocolate company triggered factory design and construction,
                                    which was completed in late 2019.

                <h3>Meet Our Founder</h3>
                <p>
                    Former biotech scientist, Dr. Gunars Valkirs, first leased the farmland in 2013 and began work on cacao farm operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout his career in San Diego, Gunars always grew fruit trees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When he moved to Maui, he was Intrigued by the fact that Hawai’i is the only state in the U.S. where cacao can be grown outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gunars began planting cacao at his home in Kapalua almost 10 years ago as part of a UH Manoa field trial to determine what growing conditions were suitable for cacao.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having previously considered making wine as a second career, Gunars realized the chocolate making process had many similar features to wine making.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wine and chocolate are also the perfect pairing, so he loved being able to explore a fascination with both at the same time.
